🚀 Learning JavaScript
Welcome to my JavaScript learning journey! This repository contains my practice code, notes, and mini-projects as I explore and build a strong foundation in JavaScript — the powerful, flexible, and essential language of the web.

📌 What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language that is one of the core technologies of the web (alongside HTML and CSS). It enables interactive web pages and is widely used in both frontend and backend development.

🧠 Why I'm Learning JavaScript
To understand how websites and web applications work.

To build interactive frontend components.

To eventually work with powerful frameworks like React, Node.js, and Express.

To improve problem-solving and logical thinking through coding.

✨ Topics I'm Covering
Variables, Data Types & Operators

Conditional Statements (if, else, else if, switch)

Loops (for, while, do-while)

Functions and Scope

Arrays & Objects

DOM Manipulation

Events and Event Listeners

ES6 Features (Arrow Functions, Template Literals, Destructuring)

Async JavaScript (Promises, Async/Await)
